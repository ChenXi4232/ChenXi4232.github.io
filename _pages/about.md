👋 Hi, I'm Wang Chen
I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), enrolled since 2021. My academic interests lie in constraint-based design and AI for Health.

I am passionate about integrating artificial intelligence with real-world complex systems, especially in scenarios where domain constraints or prior knowledge play a critical role. I aim to develop efficient and interpretable solutions for challenging problems in healthcare and design optimization.

I'm always open to collaboration and discussion — feel free to reach out! 🤝
